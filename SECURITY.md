# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Oracle values the independent security research community and believes that responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of all our users.

Please do NOT raise a GitHub Issue to report a security vulnerability. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please submit a report to secalert_us@oracle.com preferably with a proof of concept. Please refer to [Reporting Vulnerabilities](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/reporting.html) for additional information including our public encryption key for secure email. 

We ask that you do not use other channels or contact project contributors directly. 

Non-vulnerability related security issues such as new great new ideas for security features are welcome on GitHub Issues. 

### Security Updates, Alerts and Bulletins

Security updates will be released on a regular cadence. Many of our projects will typically release security fixes in conjunction with the [Oracle Critical Patch Update] (https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) program. Security updates are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. A pre-release announcement will be published on the Thursday preceding each release. For additional information including past advisories, please refer to [Security Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/).

### Security-Related Information

We will provide security related information such as a threat model, considerations for security use, or any known security issues in our documentation. Please note that labs and sample code are intended to demonstrate a concept and may not be sufficiently hardened for production use.
